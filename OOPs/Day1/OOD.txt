                                                     -------------- Let's Start ---------------


 
 #Object Oriented Design 
   
   => Low Level Designing

     

     # what is OOP's ?
        
        it is a type of Programming(coding) Technique in which all the concepts revolves arround { Classes, Objects, 4 Pillers }.

        4-Pillers: -> Inheritence
                   -> Polymorphism
                   -> Encapsulation
                   -> Abstraction


             #Class: it is a type of Design. i.e BluePrint , Templet
                
                     It have Two Properties/Components : 
                                             -> State ( Properties / Field / Data Member )
                                             -> Behaviour (function / Data Function )

                     eg: We have a ` Human ` as a Class ,then 
                              it's state will be like that : it have two Eyes
                                                             it have Two legs
                                                             it have one mouth
                                                             it have one Noise
                                                             ..etc   

                              it's Behaviour will be like that : 
                                                             it can walk
                                                             it can speak
                                                             it can fight
                                                             it can eat 
                                                             it can sleep
                                                             it can watch
                                                             ...etc  

                  -> Class takes very very small amount of Memory Space.


             #Object: Object is the instance of Class.

                  -> Object takes some amount of Memory Space.
